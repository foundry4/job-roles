# Delivery Manager

Our Delivery Managers undertake a range of work. Often you will be working as part of a multi-disciplinary squad working to delivery specific outcomes for the client, other times you might be working alongside client staff to enhance their delivery capability or providing consultancy services assessing their digital capability and maturity. Whatever you find yourself doing your team(s) and clients will look to you to provide expertise and guidance in these ways of working. 

**Knowledge and experience**

- Hands-on agile team leadership either as a product or delivery manager
- Understanding of agile working rather than specific Agile™ frameworks
- Experience of working agile within non-agile / waterfall organisations 
- Experience operating within a ‘team of teams’
- Able to define the roadmap for any given product/service and ensure this is broken down into actionable, user-centric tasks
- Can facilitate the agile planning process and communicate that to clients
- Ensure that squads deliver on time and on budget (in partnership with Delivery and Operations Directors)
- Be the voice of the project for F4 - managing communication with the client and the rest of the company
- Experience working directly with senior clients and managing their expectations throughout delivery
- Help with proposals, pitching and identifying opportunities - influencing the work we bid for and helping the company succeed.
- Experience working with client teams to support business cases and planning
- Ensure the team lives up to the ‘Code of Conduct’


**Hiring process**

Interviews will consist of an initial conversation with one of the Directors to get an idea of your work history and approach. If successful then there will be a more technical interview with the lead specialist. We don’t do riddles or whiteboards - we ask straight questions and are looking for evidence of potential as much as experience. Interviews can be in person or via the video chat client of your preference - candidates choice.

Assuming it all goes well we will make an offer.  We will also arrange an opportunity to meet other members of the team ahead of your start date. We’ll cover any expenses and give you a couple of extra days leave if you take us up on the offer.

**Ways of working**

We are not based in an office; our staff are primarily based on site with clients or work from home but we do have hubs based in Cardiff and London where you can work alongside colleagues when the opportunity arises.

We embrace a ‘small teams, loosely joined’ philosophy - teams on client sites develop their own culture and approaches.

F4 pays for the equipment you need, including your work laptop, desk rental in a co-working office or anything else that’s essential to getting stuff done.

The team meets up in person every two months - a chance to share plans, scheme new ideas and catch up with colleagues.

**Code of conduct**

All F4 staff (including contractors and freelancers) agree to accept our ‘[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/notbinary/job-roles/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md)’. This sets out unacceptable behaviours and the process to flag anything that strays from those principles. It is an evolving document and we welcome comment from team members on how we can improve it and our approach to creating a welcoming, diverse culture.
